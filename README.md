# CMU-Graphics-Projects
A portfolio of the following projects made using CMU graphics. 

These projects can only be run locally if the CMU Graphics package has been downloaded locally. 
Unfortunately, the graphics package was updated and some of my larger projects no longer work due to this.

## **Visual Selection Sort**
In this project I chose to demostate Selection Sort visually. I was inspired by [xSortLab](https://math.hws.edu/eck/js/sorting/xSortLab.html) and decided to add my own flair to the overall experience. The best way to get an idea of what I created is by trying it out [here!](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/sharing/cyanSquirrel2663).

## **Super Set** 
This project is an updated version of the game SET with various features including hints, difficulty settings, and multiple themes. Unfortunately a demo for this project is not avaliable, but I have linked photos of the project.

### Original Set Rules
- A group of 3/4 cards is considered a set.
- For each of the categories, all cards must display that feature (color, shape, line thickness, etc) all the same, or all different.
- You want to avoid choosing some cards with one feature and the other cards with a different version of that feature.

### Features
In this version of Set, you can switch between different themes, and difficulties and even play for points. If you get stuck, there is a hint function that will highlight cards that are part of a set. There is an option to change the "dimensions" of this game. These dimensions change the difficulty by adding more features to each card. For example, border thickness and rotation speed of a shape would be two attributes that would need to be taken into account if these dimensions were added.

In the future, I hope to improve the UI/UX of the game by changing the play screen to be more user-friendly.

## **Blot Shooter** 
A simple 2-player shooting game where one player (circle dot) wants to hit the other player with their "blot". I mainly wanted to explore shape-to-shape interaction and timed animation in this project. 

### How To Play
Each player takes a turn shooting their blot at the other. Depending on the distance and angle from the stationary blot, a blot will be shot at a specific angle and velocity. Above the blots, a blimp flies overhead and as the players shoot, they must avoid hitting the blimp. If the blimp is hit, the game ends, and the player who hit the blot loses.
