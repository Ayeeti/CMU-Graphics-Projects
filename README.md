# CMU-Graphics-Projects
A portfolio of the following projects made using CMU graphics. 

These projects can only be run locally if the CMU Graphics package has been downloaded locally. 
I have provided links to each project below to interact with each project.

## **Super Set** ##
This project is an updated version of the game SET with various features including hints, difficulty settings, and multiple themes.

#Features#
- Hints: Press H to get a hint!
- Difficulty: By changing dimension sizing, you can change the number of variables needed to be considered in the game. This includes the number of cards in a set.
- Themes: There are different themes to increase difficulty or just switch things up.
- Timing/Points: Find 3 sets in the shortest amount of time. If you incorrectly select a set, you will lose a life.
  
#Rules#
- A group of 3/4 cards is considered a set.
- For each of the categories, all cards must display that feature (color, shape, line thickness, etc) all the same, or all different.
- You want to avoid choosing some cards with one feature and the other cards with a different version of that feature.
