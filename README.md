# CMU-Graphics-Projects
A portfolio of the following projects made using CMU graphics. 

These projects can only be run locally if the CMU Graphics package has been downloaded locally. 
Unfortunately, the graphics package was updated and some of my larger projects no longer work as expected.


## **Super Set** 
This project is an updated version of the game SET with various features including hints, difficulty settings, and multiple themes.

### Original Set Rules
- A group of 3/4 cards is considered a set.
- For each of the categories, all cards must display that feature (color, shape, line thickness, etc) all the same, or all different.
- You want to avoid choosing some cards with one feature and the other cards with a different version of that feature.

### Features
In this version of Set, you can switch between different themes, and difficulties and even play for points. If you get stuck, there is a hint function that will highlight cards that are part of a set. There is an option to change the "dimensions" of this game. These dimensions change the difficulty by adding more features to each card. For example, border thickness and rotation speed of a shape would be two attributes that would need to be taken into account if these dimensions were added.

In the future, I hope to improve the UI/UX of the game by changing the play screen to be more user-friendly.
